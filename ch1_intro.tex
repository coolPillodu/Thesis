\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Overview}
A Smart Metering System (SMS) is composed of many Smart Meters (SM), devices that measure the consumption or production of commodities like electrical energy, gas, or water in a physical metrological measurement metering unit and transform the measured values into digital information, that can eventually be forwarded to an accounting system, and further to a billing system. 

Smart Meters for electricity, help to conserve energy and reduce carbon dioxide emissions in two ways. Firstly, dynamic pricing, dependent on the current supply situation, is possible thus making it easier to shift electricity consumptions to times when renewable energy sources (e.g., wind energy) are available. This way, less peak-load electricity generation plants-which tend to be inefficient and often based on fossil fuels-are required. Secondly, Smart Meters allow showing customers their electricity consumption in an illustrative manner, which can be a motivation for saving energy.

Although real time monitoring is advantageous there are security threats associated. It is possible to \fxnote*{ cite security threats from real time monitoring}{[]}.

Thus, security of Smart Meters represent a worst-case scenario: the devices lack sufficient power to execute strong security software; they are placed in physically non-secure location and  

The communication between the SMs and the Gateway is unmanaged, requiring self-configuration support, confidentiality of the communicated information, and may need to take place in a hostile environment. Whereas the communication between the Gateways and the accounting system is managed, requires integrity and confidentiality of the communicated accumulated information, and access to the accounting system by the power generation companies is regulated.

\section{Problem statement}
The aim of this thesis project is to design a network architecture and to enhance the network security domain so that communication in future smart metering provides secure auto-configurable networks.

The project can be divided into the following three phases:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Evaluting different alternatives for realizing the network architecture and security requirements.
\item Designing a system architecture and a demonstration scenario wherein the network could be emulated in a lab environment.
\item Realizing a proof-of-concept network and to analyze the performance metrics and the security threats of the network.
\end{enumerate}
